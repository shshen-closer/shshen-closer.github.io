<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an associate researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center. I received my Ph.D. degree in Data Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in July 2024, supervised by Prof. Enhong Chen,  and received my Bachelor degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrument from Wuhan University in July 2018. 
My research interests include data mining, knowledge discovery, user modeling, and intelligent education. I have published more than 20 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aJgNc4wAAAAJ&hl'> Google Scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>600+</span></strong></a>.
